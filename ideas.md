# Performance

- RC for vectors
- Types for mmap'ed arrays
- Matrix types
- Simple optimizations via AST rewriting
- Optimization using (static) shape analysis or manual shape annotations
- C codegen
- JIT compilation using LLVM

# Usability

- Kerf/APL-style pretty-printing
- Complex numbers as a primitive type
